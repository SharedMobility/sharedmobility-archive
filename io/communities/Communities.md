# For Local Communities

<!--
We're looking to bring on board 2-3 local <span style="display:none" class="georgia">Georgia</span> communities. 
-->The US EPA is creating [new input-output tools](../../community/tools/) for communities pursuing projects involving waste-to-energy, bioproducts and local environmental clean-up. Community participants include a coalition of representatives of diverse interests such as:

- local government
- educational institutions
- development authorities
- regional commissions
- local industry groups
- local citizen groups
- local non-profits   
- local religious organizations

## Participation Requirements
- Communities must be interested in economic development and sustainability
- Communities must commit to participation throughout the [project timeline](../about/index.html#Timeline)
- Communities must express a desire in using the tool to inform decision making

## Our Team's Commitment
- We will leverage our time, expertise and resources to develop a [community web application](../tools) for you
- Provide a team of interns to build core functionality and collect local data
- Conduct a volunteer application development event to build the application
- Activate the application tools for your community and provide training
- Provide an educational module for your schools 
- All partners will highlight your community project in national communications


## Georgia Community Interest
Contact Costas Simoglou, Energy Director at the Georgia Centers of Innovation, at 404.923.4033 or csimoglou@georgia.org if you have a group interested in participating.
