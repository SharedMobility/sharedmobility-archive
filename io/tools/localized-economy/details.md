## Design Requirements
Provide a visual of how much of what is consumed is local (within the state?)


## Technical Requirements
Local output in the region of interest must increase or industries and commodties. 
Local production has to increase to meet consumption. But local consumption may 
increase as well.

Margins have to be accurately modelled between the local and the regional scale.
