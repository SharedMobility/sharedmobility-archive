### Initial Investigations

Possible technologies and commodities to evaluate:  

- Fuels (gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel) produced using biomass (forest residues, MSW, corn stover and/or other types of waste)
- Restore, protect and expand forests to capture carbon
- [Biomass - Plastics and Chemicals](../../../../community/projects/biomass/)

- [Fast Growth Forestry](../../../../community/projects/#forestry), [Mass Timber](../../../../community/projects/wood/), [Super Wood](../../../../community/projects/#wood)
- [Biofuels Technology Summary (BETO TEA)](https://bioenergykdf.net/content/beto-biofuels-tea-database)

## Components


### USEEIO Model
- A disaggregated version of the Georgia USEEIO model in the form of a Waste Input-Output model
with new and existing biotechnologies explicitly added as new sectors, along with trade data to reflect
interregional transfers. This requires the ability to create a dissaggregated state WIO model, none of which
we currently have the full capability to create in the USEEIO Modeling Framework. 

### Non-USEEIO data
- Local biomass resources stocks
- Price data on recovered materials 
- Models of biomass recovery technologies
- Data on bio technologies that can be used for technology modeling
