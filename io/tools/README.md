# Application Concepts

These are application ideas for communities to consider and for our team to evaluate.

Each concept provides a description of the application along with a general purpose, example questions to inform,
and intended users. It had a space for design requirements which the community partners will help us with, and a
series of specific technical requirements to inform our modeling work. We should expect to refine those which the partner
communities select over the course of technical development and more interaction with the community clients.
