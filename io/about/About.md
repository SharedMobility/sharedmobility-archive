# About the Project

## Background
The EPA has created a life cycle model of goods and services in support of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/smm" target="_parent">Sustainable Materials Management</a>.
 The model is freely available and in use by experts in industry, academia (24+ US universities), the non-profit sector, and other Federal Agencies. From 2015-2018, the Center of Innovation for Energy partnered with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) and the Georgia Recycling Coalition to develop the first state version of the national USEEIO model.   

In 2019, EPA awarded a [Regional Sustainability and Environmental Sciences Research Program (RESES)](https://www.epa.gov/research/regional-sustainability-and-environmental-sciences-research-program-reses) grant
(Community-driven Application Development Using USEEIO Models) to support EPA and the Center of Innovation for Energy to work with Georgia communities to build their own interfaces to the GA model.
